**Soundsurf** is a Java-based tool for modeling 3D rooms and simulating how speakers interact within those spaces. Designed for DIY speaker builders and audio enthusiasts, it helps **visualize how sound waves reflect, interfere, and blend in different environments**. By placing multiple speakers in a virtual room, users can **analyze phase interactions, reflections, and overall acoustics** to fine-tune their setups. Whether optimizing a home audio system or experimenting with speaker placement, Soundsurf provides an interactive way to explore and improve sound performance.
